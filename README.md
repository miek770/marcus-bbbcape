# marcus-bbbcape

Beaglebone Black cape for my robot, see:

- [marcus-base](https://github.com/miek770/marcus-base)
- [marcus-boucliers](https://github.com/miek770/marcus-boucliers)

The general goal is to reduce the amount of loose wires on the robot and the required space. The current platform is not compact at all, and adding more stuff (ex.: cannon, turrent, shields) seems like quite the challenge.

Ideally I would use Molex connectors but it would probably eat too much space. I would like to keep the PCB as small as possible, mostly to keep the cost down.

The cape should be stackable, which means that P8 and P9 should be female headers with long leads. The alternative would be male headers mounted on the bottom.

## To do list

- Add other interfaces;
- Document pins usage;
- Think about future expansions;
- Complete and check pretty much everything.
