## To do list

- Check which pins I can really use for the shield circuit;
- Check if I can power the BBB from the headers;
- Connect the bumpers (BC is an input, B0 to B3 are outputs);
- Add other interfaces;
- Add firing circuit;
- Add reset button?
- Document pins usage;
- Think about future expansions;
- Complete and check pretty much everything.
